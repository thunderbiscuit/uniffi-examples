# Supported Languages

Uniffi natively supports the following languages:

1. Kotlin
2. Swift
3. Python
4. Ruby

You can use these to compose libraries for different use cases:

1. Kotlin on JVM server-side
2. Kotlin on Android
3. Swift on iOS
4. Java (though Kotlin interop)
5. Kotlin + Swift to generate React Native libraries
6. Kotlin + Swift to generate Flutter libraries

Alternatively, Mozilla is building the uniffi-rs library to allow for a plugin system to emerge and enable further languages to be supported outside the 4 "core" languages already supported. Projects are in the works for:
1. [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://gitlab.com/trixnity/uniffi-kotlin-multiplatform-bindings)
2. [Go](https://github.com/NordSecurity/uniffi-bindgen-go)
3. [C#](https://github.com/NordSecurity/uniffi-bindgen-cs)
